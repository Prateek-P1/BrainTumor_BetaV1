# Brain Tumor Detection, Segmentation with an integrated 3-D viewport

This project aims to detect and segment Brain Tumors from 3-Dimensional Brain MRI Scans in the NIFTI (.nii) file format. <br>
The BraTS2020 dataset was used.

A U-net model was used with the "nibabel" library in python.
Further improvements are underway. Feel free to contribute and collaborate <br>
